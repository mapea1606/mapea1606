### About Me 🌟

Passionate **junior data analyst** with a strong quantitative foundation and a genuine love for transforming complex data into clear, actionable business insights.  

Comfortable working with **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn for EDA and visualization) and **mathematics** — which allows me to approach problems analytically, understand statistical concepts deeply, and deliver rigorous, reliable analysis from day one.

**What I bring to the table**  
- **SQL** — Proficient in writing complex queries, joins, window functions, CTEs and aggregations for efficient data extraction  
- **Python** — Strong EDA, data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis  
- **Statistics** — Solid grasp of descriptive/inferential methods to identify patterns and validate findings  
- **Visualization & Storytelling** — Building intuitive dashboards (Power BI, Tableau Public) and presenting insights that drive decisions  
- **Excel** — Advanced level (pivot tables, Power Query, dynamic reports) for quick business analysis  

I'm proactive, detail-oriented, and thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute immediately while continuously learning.  

**Open to growing** — I'm excited to expand into more technical areas like data engineering (pipelines, dbt, cloud tools) and AI/ML fundamentals, making me adaptable to hybrid or evolving roles in fast-moving teams.

Looking for my first **junior data analyst** opportunity (or internship) where I can apply these skills to solve real problems and add value from the start. Let's connect!
